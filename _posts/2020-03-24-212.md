# Public Economic Interventions For Coronavirus

I’m collecting [resources and guideline that could serve member of authorities to organize financial and other interventions](http://zucchetti.ch/public-economic-interventions-for-coronavirus) to respond to the coronavirus crisis. I’m focusing not on the specific measures but on how urgent decision can be better organized and the quality can improved and verified.

I have studied the authorities response to the September 11 attacks in 2001, to the Swissair grounding in 2002, to the financial crisis of 2008 and I have followed and analyzed the outcomes. I have noticed that, due to the urgency and magnitude of the problems, the measures that have been taken to alleviate the different crisis, in some case have not played out as expected and have also created imbalances. These big urgent interventions have a similar pattern of producing side inefficiencies, that can be mitigated with some improvements.  
 The coronavirus is unprecedented. There is not a receipt that can be applied, but nonetheless it is possible to highlight some elements that can improve the effectiveness of measures and help preserve other important elements of our society and economy.
